# Index – A minimal portfolio and blog theme for Kirby CMS

![Screenshot of the Index Theme for Kirby CMS](kirby-index-theme-screenshot.jpg)

A minimal portfolio and blog theme for Kirby CMS. Built for Kirby 5 + PHP 8.4.

Index is built for easy updates, not elaborate structure. No menu, no case studies, no complex navigation – because in my experience, that's where people get stuck and stop updating their portfolios.

List your work. Write when you want. That's it. The templates are simple to extend if you need more later.

## Features

### RSS Feed
Built-in RSS feed for your blog. Let readers subscribe and follow your writing without any extra setup.

### Sitemap
Automatic XML sitemap generation for search engines. Better indexing out of the box.

### Minimal CSS
Under 6kb of CSS. Fast loading, easy to understand, simple to modify. No preprocessors, no frameworks, no complexity.

### Adjustable colors (two-color palette)
Pick your primary and accent color. That's it. The constraint keeps your site cohesive and makes customization trivial. Change two variables, done.

### Adjustable font (one font)
Choose one typeface that works everywhere. Swap it out in seconds. Mono, sans-serif, serif – whatever fits your style. The single-font constraint creates visual consistency without effort.

### Breadcrumbs and basic SEO fields
Essential SEO handled for you. Page titles, meta descriptions, breadcrumbs for navigation context. The basics done right.

### No build tools
No npm, no build process, no compilation step. Edit templates, refresh browser. That's it. Perfect for quick tweaks and easy deployment.
