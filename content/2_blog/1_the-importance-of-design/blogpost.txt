Dieter Rams put it plainly: *Less, but better.* Every element should earn its place. If it does not serve a purpose, remove it. This is as true for a physical object as it is for a button on a screen.

When design is done well, nobody notices it. The door opens the right way. The form submits without confusion. The page loads before impatience sets in. Good design is invisible — it gets out of the way and lets the person using it get on with what they actually came to do.

That is what I try to keep in mind when I build things.
