Title: Style Guide

----

Text-content:

This is a demonstration of all available formatting options in Markdown. Use this as a reference when writing new posts.

## Text Formatting

You can use **bold text** for emphasis or *italic text* for subtle stress. For even more emphasis, you can combine them: ***bold and italic***. Sometimes you need `inline code` when referencing functions or variables.

## Heading 2
### Heading 3

## Lists

### Unordered List

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
- Fourth item

### Ordered List

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
   1. Sub-step
   2. Another sub-step
4. Final step

## Links and References

You can create [inline links](https://sans.supply) or reference external resources. For example, check out [Dieter Rams' ten principles](https://www.vitsoe.com/us/about/good-design) for good design.

## Blockquotes

> Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
>
> — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

Blockquotes are perfect for highlighting important quotes or emphasizing key points.

## Code Blocks

Here's an example of a simple PHP function:
```php
<?php

function formatDate($timestamp) {
    return date('F j, Y', $timestamp);
}

// Usage
$post_date = formatDate(time());
echo "Published: " . $post_date;

// Output: Published: January 12, 2024

?>
```

Syntax highlighting makes code more readable and helps distinguish between different elements.

## Horizontal Rules

You can add visual breaks between sections:

---

Like that. Use them sparingly to separate distinct topics or create breathing room in longer posts.

## Nested Elements

You can combine different elements:

1. **Lists with bold text**
   - And *italic nested items*
   - With `inline code references`
2. Links and emphasis: Check out [**this important resource**](https://example.com)

## Best Practices

- Keep paragraphs short and focused
- Use headings to create clear hierarchy
- Add code blocks when showing technical examples
- Break up long sections with horizontal rules
- Use emphasis sparingly—when everything is bold, nothing is

---

That covers the essential Markdown formatting options. Write clearly, format intentionally, and let the content speak for itself.
